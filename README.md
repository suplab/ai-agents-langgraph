# AI Agents in LangGraph

This repository contains structured Python notebooks for learning and building **controllable AI agents** using **LangGraph**.  
The material progresses from first principles to production-grade agent systems.

The emphasis is on **explicit control flow**, **state management**, and **human oversight**, not prompt hacking.
